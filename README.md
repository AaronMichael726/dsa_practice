### Big O Analysis

---
Function 1 Time Complexity:

Explain your answer: O(1) - only runs once
```
function bobIsFirst(people){
  return people[0] == 'bob'
}
```
---
Function 2 Time Complexity:

Explain your answer:
```
function wordOccurrence(word, phrase){
  let result = 0
  const array = phrase.split(' ')
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    if(word.toLowerCase() === array[i].toLowerCase()){
      result++;
    }
  }
  return result
}
```
---
Function 3 Time Complexity:

Explain your answer: O(n) runs as many times as list is long
```
function sort(list){
  for(let i = 0; i < list.length - 1; i++){
    for(let j  = 0; j < list.length - 2; j++){
      if(list[j+1] < list[j]){
        const temp = list[j];
        list[j] = list[j+1];
        list[j+1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return list;
}
```

### Written Questions

- What method would you use to look up a word in a dictionary (book, not Python)?
- Binary Search

- Imagine you have a closet full of shirts. What can you do to organize your shirts for easy retrieval?
- Bucket Sort

- Describe advantages and disadvantages of the most popular sorting algorithms.

The issue with most sorting algorithms is time complexity.  How long does it take to sort the large amounts of data.  Bubble Sort has a terrible time complexity, but quick sorts is much easier.  When you are looking at a bucket sort the question becomes 1) How much data do you have and 2) What do you need to do with that data?
